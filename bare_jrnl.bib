abstract = {WPANs (Wireless Personal Area Networks) fill an important role in local area network technology complementing traditional IEEE 802.11 Wireless LANs. Bluetooth, ZigBee and NFC (Near Field Communications) have emerged as the key WPAN technologies. They are however subject to the usual range of security vulnerabilities found in wireless LANs such as spoofing, snooping, man-in-the-middle, denial of service and other attacks. However security in WPANs is not as mature as it is in Wireless LANs and further work is needed in order to provide comparable protection. This paper examines a range of vulnerabilities and security attacks that can be performed on Bluetooth, ZigBee and NFC WPANs and proposes protection mechanisms that can mitigate risk in each case.},

@article{Cirani2013,
abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the Internet-like structure of billions of interconnected constrained devices, denoted as “smart objects”. Smart objects have limited capabilities, in terms of computational power and memory, and might be battery-powered devices, thus raising the need to adopt particularly energy efficient technologies. Among the most notable challenges that building interconnected smart objects brings about, there are standardization and interoperability. The use of IP has been foreseen as the standard for interoperability for smart objects. As billions of smart objects are expected to come to life and IPv4 addresses have eventually reached depletion, IPv6 has been identified as a candidate for smart-object communication. The deployment of the IoT raises many security issues coming from (i) the very nature of smart objects, e.g., the adoption of lightweight cryptographic algorithms, in terms of processing and memory requirements; and (ii) the use of standard protocols, e.g., the need to minimize the amount of data exchanged between nodes. This paper provides a detailed overview of the security challenges related to the deployment of smart objects. Security protocols at network, transport, and application layers are discussed, together with lightweight cryptographic algorithms proposed to be used instead of conventional and demanding ones, in terms of computational resources. Security aspects, such as key distribution and security bootstrapping, and application scenarios, such as secure data aggregation and service authorization, are also discussed.},

    abstract = {We have witnessed the Fixed Internet emerging with virtually every computer being connected today; we are currently witnessing the emergence of the Mobile Internet with the exponential explosion of smart phones, tablets and net-books. However, both will be dwarfed by the anticipated emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), in which everyday objects are able to connect to the Internet, tweet or be queried. Whilst the impact onto economies and societies around the world is undisputed, the technologies facilitating such a ubiquitous connectivity have struggled so far and only recently commenced to take shape. To this end, this paper introduces in a timely manner and for the first time the wireless communications stack the industry believes to meet the important criteria of power-efficiency, reliability and Internet connectivity. Industrial applications have been the early adopters of this stack, which has become the de- facto standard, thereby bootstrapping early IoT developments with already thousands of wireless nodes deployed. Corroborated throughout this paper and by emerging industry alliances, we believe that a standardized approach, using latest developments in the IEEE 802.15.4 and IETF working groups, is the only way forward.We introduce and relate key embodiments of the power-efficient IEEE 802.15.4-2006 PHY layer, the power- saving and reliable IEEE 802.15.4e MAC layer, the IETF 6LoW- PAN adaptation layer enabling universal Internet connectivity, the IETF ROLL routing protocol enabling availability, and finally the IETF CoAP enabling seamless transport and support of Internet applications. The protocol stack proposed in the present work converges towards the standardized notations of the ISO/OSI and TCP/IP stacks. What thus seemed impossible some years back, i.e., building a clearly defined, standards-compliant and Internet- compliant stack given the extreme restrictions of IoT networks, is commencing to become reality.},

    abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) was of a vision in which all physical objects are tagged and uniquely identified using RFID transponders or readers. Nowadays, research into the IoT has extended this vision to the connectivity of Things to anything, anyone, anywhere and at anytime. The IoT has grown into multiple dimensions, which encompasses various networks of applications, computers, devices, as well as physical and virtual objects, referred to as things or objects, that are interconnected together using communication technologies such as, wireless, wired and mobile networks, RFID, Bluetooth, GPS systems, and other evolving technologies. This paradigm is a major shift from an essentially computer-based network model to a fully distributed network of smart objects. This change poses serious challenges in terms of architecture, connectivity, efficiency, security and provision of services among many others. This paper studies the state-of-the art of the IoT. In addition, some major security and privacy issues are described and a new attack vector is introduced, referred to as the “automated invasion attack”.},

The Internet is used, amongst other things for obtaining information, for doing business and for social networking. However, along with increases in cyber activity come increases in cyber threats, attacks and incidents. Many home users are not technology savvy and, therefore, do not understand these cyber threats or how to protect themselves (and their information) while connected to the Internet. It is therefore vital that home users be assisted to ensure that they are “cyber secure”. The paper proposes how a regulatory body, for example, an Internet Service Provider (ISP), can be involved to take over the majority of cyber security responsibilities for the home (end) user. This will transform a user from being a thick security- oriented user to being a thin security-oriented end user.},

It will contribute to assert the concept of Internet of Things, where end- to-end security represents a key issue. In such context, it is very important to understand which protocols are able to provide the right level of security without burdening the limited resources of constrained networks. This paper presents a performance comparison between two of the most widely used security protocols: IPSec and DTLS. We provide the analysis of their impact on the resources of embedded devices. For this purpose, we have modified existing implementations of both protocols to make them properly run on our hardware platforms, and we have performed an extensive experimental evaluation study. The achieved results are not a consequence of a classical simulation campaign, but they have been obtained in a real scenario that uses software and hardware typical of the current technological developments. Therefore, they can help network designers to identify the most appropriate secure mechanism for end-to-end IP communications involving constrained devices.},

IP protocols, such as IPv6, TCP and HTTP will be further complemented by IPv6 over Low powerWireless Personal Area Networks and Constrained Application Protocol currently in development in IETF. Security and privacy are a must for the IP-based IoTs in order to ensure its acceptance. However, mobility, limited bandwidth, and resource-constrained devices pose new challenges and require for a sound and efficient security architecture. In particular, dynamic association of mobile smart objects and the management of keys in large-scale networks remain an open challenge. In this context, we propose a flexible security architecture based on the Host Identity Protocol and Multimedia Internet KEYing protocols allowing for secure network association and key management. HIP - based on asymmetric-key cryptography - ensures unambiguous thing identification, mobility support, as well as a lightweight and secure method for network association. In our solution, HIP is extended with MIKEY capabilities to provide enhanced key management using polynomials, which allow to generate pairwise keys with any node based on its identity. This combination of protocols and crypto-algorithms ensures both strong security and very good performance as shown by our implementation and presents clear advantages compared with other alternatives.},

We describe an efficient and full plaintext recovery attack against the OpenSSL imple- mentation of DTLS, and a partial plaintext recovery attack against the GnuTLS implementation of DTLS. The attack against the OpenSSL implementation is a variant of Vaude- nay’s padding oracle attack and exploits small timing differ- ences arising during the cryptographic processing of DTLS packets. It would have been prevented if the OpenSSL im- plementation had been in accordance with the DTLS RFC. In contrast, the GnuTLS implementation does follow the DTLS RFC closely, but is still vulnerable to attack. The attacks require new insights to overcome the lack of error messages in DTLS and to amplify the timing differences. We discuss the reasons why these implementations are insecure, drawing lessons for secure protocol design and implemen- tation in general.},
