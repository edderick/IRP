\author{Edward~Seabrook, University~of~Southampton }

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
As the number and types of devices in the modern home grows, so does the
possibility for malicious actors to exploit them. The network technology
powering the Internet of Things must be designed with security and privacy
considerations in mind from the start. In this paper, a thorough review of the
protocol stack, security considerations and prevention mechanisms is given.

\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} ``Internet of Things'' (IoT) has become a popular
buzzword; the term is thrown around liberally, despite lacking an agreed
definition. Kevin Ashton was the first to use the phrase in 1999, while
describing the combination of RFID tags and the Internet to monitor the supply
chain at Procter \& Gamble \cite{Ashton2009}. 

A few years later, in 2005, the ITU published a report titled ``The Internet of
Things'' \cite{ITU_IoT}, which discussed how RFID could be used to give objects
from the real world a presence on the Internet. The ideas presented in the
report added a new dimension to the Internet, envisioning a future where
Internet connectivity would be available at ``anytime'', in ``any place'', and
to ``anything''.

More recent definitions of the IoT have not limited themselves to RFID,
favouring more feature rich protocols, such as IEEE 802.14.5, Bluetooth Low
Energy (BLE) and even WiFi. The core theme that all definitions agree on, is
that as the IoT enters the mainstream, the number of Internet connected devices
will skyrocket -- Gartner predicts that by 2020, there will be over 26 billion
devices connected to the Internet \cite{Gartner2014}. 

Although ``things'' tend to steal the limelight, it is important not to neglect
the increasing presence of more traditional devices on the Internet. This
conjunction of the traditional Internet, and the emerging IoT, has been
referred to as ``the Internet of Everything'' \cite{CiscoEverything}. 

As we enter this increasingly connected age, security becomes a growing
concern. With more devices and greater heterogeneity, the number of attack
surfaces grows. The first generation Internet took a lax approach to security,
focusing first on achieving functionality \cite{Bhimani1996}. This has lead to
an Internet that is insecure by default. Only recently have larger websites
begun using encrypted sessions to secure communications with their users -- it
was not until July 2013 that Facebook offered Transport Layer Security (TLS) as
the default \cite{Facebook2013}. 

There has been a large amount of attention recently placed on the IoT in a
business and industrial context. Discussions of wireless sensor networks (WSN)
used to monitor manufacturing and agriculture, ensuring optimal production
capacity, along with proposals of complex policy management frameworks, are
common place. Interesting work has also been done in the area of vehicle
networks: at Def Con 21, a horrifying demonstration showed it was possible to
take control of some modern cars putting the passengers in potentially
fatal danger \cite{Illera2014}. There are clearly important security issues in
these areas, especially with respect to critical infrastructure.  However, this
paper chooses to focus on the deployment of the IoT in a residential setting. 

Home networks offer a unique challenge: they are rarely serviced by a competent,
professional systems administrator, and  contain an increasing range of
intimate devices and appliances from a variety of inexpensive vendors
\cite{ACM_ModHome}. As such, security requirements are high, while the
difficulty of configuring the network must be very low. 


\section{Technologies}
In the early days of the Internet, there were many competing standards: DECnet,
TCP/IP, AppleTalk, OSI, x.25 and many more. Eventually TCP/IP was accepted as
the main protocol suite, and is now used almost exclusively. Similarly, there
are many competing technology stacks for the IoT. There are advantages and
disadvantages to each potential architecture, and few exist within a vacuum --
each draws inspiration from the rest. 

As with the Internet, it is convenient to think about the IoT in terms of the
seven layer OSI model\footnote{Although TCP/IP won the battle, the numberings
from the OSI model are still widely used in industry}. The TCP/IP model is
designed with a narrow waist at the Network (IP) Layer, with many choices of
protocol sitting above and below it. This has been a key feature to the success
of TCP/IP as it provides a strong decoupling of applications from the
underlying network hardware.

\subsection{Layers 1 \& 2 -- The Physical and Link Layers}
\label{layer_1_2}
The Physical Layer (PHY) defines the medium used for the transmission of
messages. The Link Layer, also referred to as the Medium Access Control
(MAC) Layer, defines the way in which the PHY Layer is accessed. Traditional
networks made use of wired connections (such as Ethernet over Cat 5 cabling)
for this purpose. However, due to the expense and inconvenience of installing
wired networks, consumers have transitioned towards wireless technologies. 

\subsubsection{WiFi}
IEEE 802.11 is the set of specifications defining WiFi. WiFi is probably the
most familiar wireless networking protocol to home users. The latest standard
for WiFi is 802.11ac, which went to market in 2012 and boasts theoretical
maximum throughput of 6.77Gbit/s. 

WiFi is common as a wireless alternative to Ethernet, used to connect laptops,
mobile phones and tablets to wireless local area networks (WLANs). For devices
with mains connectivity or large batteries, where cost is not a major factor,
and high bandwidth is required, WiFi is a sensible choice. However, the high
power usage makes it unsuitable for constrained devices in the IoT.

\subsubsection{Bluetooth}
Bluetooth is a wireless communication technology used in Personal Area Networks
(PANs), intended as a wireless replacement for RS-232 serial cables. It
operates in the Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band, and is used
primarily for connecting mobile phones to headsets. Bluetooth has a lower
bandwidth and energy usage than WiFi, so is more suitable for connecting
constrained devices than WiFi. Unlike WiFi, Bluetooth also defines the higher
network layers. 

\subsubsection{Bluetooth Low Energy}
While Bluetooth was designed with power requirements in mind, it is not
suitable for ultra-low power devices. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), originally
named Wibree and now marketed as Bluetooth Smart, is a non-backwards
compatible protocol designed to require far less power than the Bluetooth
Classic. 

One of the main advantages of BLE is that it can share an antenna with
Bluetooth Classic, making it relatively inexpensive for hardware manufactures
to implement.  Following the Apple iPhone 4S in 2011 \cite{Engadget2011}, many
smartphones with support for BLE have been released.

\subsubsection{RFID}
Much of the early work on the IoT focused on Radio-frequency Identification
(RFID). There are two basic types of RFID "tag": active tags, which are powered
by the reader; and passive tags, which have their own power source. The main
benefit of RFID is that passive tags can be created very cheaply -- the
cheapest tags cost around \pounds0.05. More expensive active RFID tags can
have similar functionality to the other PHY layer standards. 

\subsubsection{IEEE 802.15.4}
IEEE 802.15.4 is a PHY layer technology designed specifically for the IoT. It
has very low energy usage and bandwidth. The minuscule energy requirement makes
802.15.4 ideal for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) where batteries cannot be
replaced regularly. 

\subsubsection{Mobile Standards}
There are also many standards that are used in the cellular mobile telephones
-- most notably 3G and 4G/LTE. In developing countries without much previous
generation network infrastructure, we are already seeing consumers who are
jumping straight to mobile technologies without ever using cable/broadband
internet \cite{Kritzinger2013}. For many `things', mobile broadband may be an
effective way of providing connectivity.  

WiMAX is another mobile technology that could have impact in the IoT. WiMAX
falls between 3G and WiFi in terms of range and speed, but is yet to be widely
deployed.  

\subsection{Layer 3 - The Network Layer}
The network layer is the narrow waist of the TCP/IP stack, there is essentially
only one choice, IP. 

\subsubsection{IP}
The near universal use of the Internet Protocol (IP) by machines connected to
the Internet gives it a great deal of importance. IP has two major versions:
IPv4 and IPv6, although most networks today use IPv4. In 2011 the Internet
Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) ran out of IPv4 addresses \cite{Potaroo},
meaning IPv6 should be used in the future -- this has the positive side effect
of providing a virtually unbounded address space for addressing `things'. 

\subsubsection{6LoWPAN}
IP was not designed with constrained devices in mind -- as a result, it is too
resource intensive to run on many `things'. 6LoWPAN is a protocol designed as a
minimalistic subset of IPv6 that can run over IEEE 802.15.4\footnote{Work has
also begun to port 6LoWPAN to BLE.}. It includes features such as header
compression and packet fragmentation. 6LoWPAN can be statelessly translated
into IPv6 via an inexpensive bridge or gateway. 

\subsubsection{ZigBee}
ZigBee is a wireless mesh networking protocols suite that runs above IEEE
802.15.4. It is designed to be a low cost option for connecting devices that
require low power usage, and little bandwidth. ZigBee defines the network
layer, the application layer and the high-level concept of a ZigBee device
object (ZDO). Classic ZigBee was not directly compatible with IP, making
integration with the Internet difficult. The ZigBee Alliance have since
released specifications for an IPv6 based version of ZigBee.

\subsubsection{WirelessHART}
WirelessHART is also built on top of IEEE 802.15.4, it is designed for
industrial automation. It is a more proprietary protocol, but has had a large
amount of attention in academic literature.  

\subsection{Layer 4 - The Transport Layer}
The transport layer primarily provides multiplexing for applications. There are
two major Layer 4 protocols:  UDP and TCP. User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is
connectionless, providing no guarantee of message delivery.  Transmission
Control Protocol (TCP), on the other hand, is connection-oriented, and by
retransmitting failed messaged offers a reliable service. Because of overheads
relating to retransmission and maintain connections, TCP is unsuitable for the
low power lossy networks (LLNs) of the IoT \cite{embedded}. Instead UDP is
used, with reliability handled in the higher layers.

\subsection{Layer 7 - The Application Layer}
The application layer is probably the widest layer, since any application can
define an application layer if required. There are many familiar
application layer protocols that we use on a daily basis, including SSH,
FTP, XMPP, and SMTP. 

\subsubsection{HTTP} 
Thanks to the huge popularity of the World Wide Web (W3), RESTful webservices
have become very common, making HTTP a de facto standard for inter-application
communication. HTTP is a text based protocol that uses verbs such as `GET' and
`POST', to interact with a web server.  

\subsubsection{CoAP}
HTTP was not designed to be lightweight, instead it focused on human
readability. For constrained devices, HTTP is simply too bandwidth and power
intensive. The Constrained Applications Protocol (CoAP) is designed as a
compatible subset of HTTP. It is not a naive compression of HTTP, but rather a
completely new protocol with a stateless one-to-one mapping to (and from) HTTP. 

\subsubsection{EXI}
Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) is a binary format based on XML, that aims to
reduce the overheads needed for transmitting and parsing XML documents. XML is
a widely used document format on the internet, but due to its human readable
verbosity, it is not ideal for embedded devices where small overheads can make
processing impossible. 

\subsection{Other Protocols}
As well as the protocols that fall neatly into the OSI model, there are also
other protocols and services that are required for the IoT to function. These
include naming and service discovery, along with middleware that can be used to
simplify the development of applications for the IoT.

\subsubsection{Service Discovery}
For objects to interact seamlessly, mechanisms are required for objects to
discover the existence of one another. For example, a network connected light
switch may need to locate all the lightbulbs that it is responsible for. There
are a number of service discovery protocols for traditional IP networks,
including UPnP and mDNS (Apple Bonjour). There are implementations of mDNS
that can run on 6LoWPANs. It is also possible that we will see new service
discovery protocols used on the IoT; one example is TRENDY \cite{Butt2013}. 

\subsubsection{Routing}
Under some circumstances it is necessary to route network traffic over
constrained device networks. Traditional routing protocols such as The Routing
Information Protocol (RIP) and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), are far too
heavy weight to run on most devices. As such the IETFRouting Over Low-power
Lossy networks (ROLL) working group has been chartered, and have developed RPL:
IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks.  

\subsubsection{Auto-configuration}
To remove the need for home users to manually configure their networks, a number of
technologies have been developed to automatically configure the hosts.
Stateless Address Auto-configuration (SLAAC) is part of IPv6 and is used to
generate host IP addresses based on information included in Router
Advertisements, which are flooded to the subnet by routers as part of the
Neighbour Discover Protocol (NPD). 

\subsection{Overall Architecture}
It is very difficult right now to identify which set of protocols will dominate
the IoT. At present, the academic and standards communities are confident that
an IP based IoT will emerge. If this is the case, then the architecture
detailed in \cite{Palattella2013} is a good candidate as a standard protocol
stack. This architecture uses IEEE 802.15.4 as the PHY and MAC layers; 6LoWPAN
as the network layer; UDP for the transport layer; and CoAP as the Application
layer. This architecture is a good choice because it offers excellent
compatibility with the traditional Internet, while avoiding degradation in the
performance of the IoT with heavy, power intensive protocols. It would also be
possible to run a similar protocol stack switching 6LoWPAN for BLE. 

In contrast, many of the ``smart'' devices available to consumers right now do
not follow this architecture. At the most basic end of this scale, we see home
automation kits based on simple radios (typically 433MHz), running proprietary
protocols, connecting to base stations or mobile phones. Examples of this
include LightWaveRF and Insteon. Home automation is currently targeted mostly
at enthusiasts who are willing to build systems themselves using Raspberry Pi
and Arduino.  

Many mainstream devices use WiFi or Bluetooth Classic. LG and Whirlpool are
both manufacturing ranges of appliances with WiFi connectivity. Nest, a popular
manufacturer of smart thermostats -- now owned by Google -- support both WiFi
and 802.15.4 on their devices. The Fitbit and Nike Fuel band both connect to
smart phones over Bluetooth. These commercially available devices often lack
the always-on, global connectivity envisioned in the IoT, instead connecting
to a single device which is used as an application layer proxy.


\section{Security Goals}
For many the Internet is no longer a luxury but a lifeline. Many everyday tasks
have been greatly simplified by the Internet. The IoT will exaggerate this
effect, increasing our reliance on technology. Interconnected `things' in our
homes will collect huge amounts of sensitive information, and will control
almost everything we own -- it is paramount that we avoid anything bad
happening to these devices, the consequences could be catastrophic.

As we transition from an Internet containing only virtual entities to an
Internet that includes real world objects, the damages that will be possible
through attack or data leak are increasing. There are many security and privacy
goals that must be met for users to be confident placing trust in the IoT.

\subsection{Confidentiality}
A confidential message should be readable only by the intended recipient(s).
Mechanisms are needed to ensure that attackers can not intercept and understand
any messages that are transmitted. The level of confidentiality required varies
depending on the use case. For example, a temperature sensor in a public place
probably does not convey any information that an attacker could not collect for
themselves. On the other hand, a sensor that monitors a medical condition, has
much higher confidentiality requirements. Wireless communication is
particularly susceptible to interception, this should not be allowed to reduce
the confidentiality of the messages.  

\subsection{Integrity}
Integrity is the concept that a received message is identical to what was sent.
Means of ensuring a message does not change during transmission are required.
If alteration does occur, it should be either automatically corrected, or
discarded. A message could be altered accidentally, through error in the
transmission process, or it could be tampered with maliciously by an attacker.
As the IoT will rely mainly on wireless communications, both malicious and
accidental changes are likely. An example is when a user sets their smart
thermostat, they expect the temperature of the house to adjust to what they
set, not a much higher or lower temperature.  

\subsection{Availability}
Availability refers to the ability to make use of a service when it is needed.
On the regular Internet Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are fairly common
place, and without suitable provisions can render websites or networks
completely unusable. The IoT needs ways to both prevent `things' from being the
affected by availability reduction attacks, and from being used as the source of DoS
attacks. Although it would be beneficial to connect many critical systems to
the IoT, until availability can be guaranteed, this should not be done.

\subsection{Non-repudiation}
Non-repudiation mechanisms ensure that an action performed by somebody, cannot
later be denied. There does not currently appear to be any uses for
non-repdudiation in the IoT. 

\subsection{Authenticity}
An authentic message is one that was sent by the party from which it claims to
have been sent. In the IoT protocols should provide a way of preventing
attackers, for example, from pretending to be sensor nodes, and submitting
bogus readings, leading to undesired actions. It may be helpful in the IoT to
extend authenticity to provenance, recording a complete history of the origin
of data.  

\subsection{Authorisation}
Authorisation ensures that the party sending a command is allowed
to make a given request. Presently, we often see WiFi routers
and other embedded devices that ship with well known default usernames
and password. This makes it very easy for an attacker to guess the login
credentials. If things do not change, then we are likely to see the same
phenomenon in the IoT. In early 2014, Proofpoint found that many low power
devices, including one smart refrigerator, were being used to send spam emails
\cite{Proofpoint2014}.

Authorisation is a very important security goal. Theoretical horror stories
include the ability for attackers to unlock doors, or gain access to personal
webcameras.  

\subsection{Usability \& Accessibility}
Although not strictly a security goal, when designing systems, it is of
adamant importance that usability is considered. For a secure system to be
successful, the target audience must not struggle to use it -- if the end
user is unable to configure devices in a secure manner, then there may as well
be no security at all.

It is important to remember that not only do the majority of home users of the
IoT lack a deep technical understanding of the hardware and software that they
are using, they also often do not have the time or the will to learn.  As such,
the workflow of enabling security should be as simple as possible. One way of
achieving this may be to hide as much of the underlying cryptographic mechanism
as possible from the end user.

In the past, accessibility has often been ignored all together when designing
secure systems -- WiFi passwords are typically printed in tiny writing on the
underside of routers, making the task of discovering WiFi passwords difficult
even for able bodies people. For many goals of the IoT to be reached,
especially with regards to devices designed to help people with disabilities,
accessibility needs to be made a priority.  


\section{Security Threats}
It is difficult to develop a strategy of prevention and mitigation without
first understanding some of the potential attacks that must be defended
against.  

\subsection{Attack Types}
Ning et al \cite{Ning2013} divide the types of attack into the following
four broad categories:

\subsubsection{Gathering}
Gathering attacks involve collecting information by eavesdropping on
communications channels, or gaining access to storage areas. As a result of the
Snowden leaks in 2013, it was revealed that the US government has been
collecting metadata on the communications of civilians around the world. In
response the Guardian published an article detailing the extend of the
information that can be inferred from metadata alone \cite{Guardian2013}.
Gathering attacks are a breach of confidentiality. 

\subsubsection{Imitation}
Pretending to be someone (or something) you are not, in order to gain access to
a resource that you are not authorised to gain access to. A classic attack is
MAC address spoofing which can be used to perform a variety of attacks. Replay
attacks are also a form of imitation that must be defended against. This
category of attacks includes man-in-the-middle attacks, whereby an attacker
intercepts all communications between two parties, and relays the
communications fooling the two end points into believing they are communicating
directly. 

\subsubsection{Blocking}
Blocking refers to reducing the availability of a service. Blocking can be
achieved at almost any layer of the network. At the physical layer, radio
frequencies can be jammed; at the application layer, resources can be consumed
unnecessarily by an attacker. The most well known form of a blocking attack is
Denial of Service (DoS). 

\subsubsection{Privacy}
Privacy attacks seek to deprive victims of their privacy. One of major concerns
is of the identification of people in public places, based on the devices that
they are carrying. In 2006 security researchers at the Black Hat conference
\cite{Flexilis2006} expressed concerns that a side channel attack on the
proposed US e-passports could be used to identify travellers as American
citizens while they were travelling abroad, exposing them to unnecessary risk.

Since an increasing number of devices contain Global Positioning System (GPS)
modules, the privacy of a user's geographic location is also a strong concern.

\subsection{Attack Levels}
In \cite{Elkhodr2013} the types of attack are separated into five different
levels. These attacks refer to information security, the practice of
restricting access to data to certain groups, and are applicable mostly to
privacy issues in the IoT.

\subsubsection{First-Hand Attack}
In a first hand attack, a user inadvertently divulges some information to
another party. Either through misconfigured privacy settings, or through the
breach of a vulnerable security protocol, an attacker can gain valuable
(possibly personal) information, that they would not otherwise have been able
to gain. Although it would be easy to blame poorly configured privacy
settings\footnote{Or insecure passwords for that matter.} on the user
themselves, a security breach that results from a difficult to use system,
could be considered to be the fault of the system designers. 

\subsubsection{Gossip Attack}
A gossip attack is one in which the attacker gains sensitive information by
compromising a node that does not directly interact with the victim. This node
may be several hops from the target, and well beyond the victim's control, yet
it is possible that other nodes have relayed data regarding the target to it.
As a result, emphasis must be placed on deciding which peers to trust, and what
information should be shared with them.

\subsubsection{Observation Attack}
An observation attack makes use of sensors placed (or compromised) by an
attacker with the intent of gaining information about their victims. An
attacker might also attempt to capture network traffic with the aim of
obtaining some information about the victim. Unlike the other attacks, an
observation attack may make use of strategically placed sensors owned by the
attacker themself.

\subsubsection{Inference Attack}
Inference attacks exploit the huge body of data that will be collected in the
IoT. Data can be linked in unexpected ways, in order to obtain sensitive
information that was not revealed by any data source alone. Understanding
privacy in anonymised datasets is an active research area. Large amounts of
work are being done on differential privacy and similar concepts. In 2007
Netflix launched a competition to improve their user ratings of filmsr. Soon
after the competition was launched, two researchers from the University of
Texas announced they were able to identify individual users by correlating the
data with the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) \cite{Narayanan2008}.

\subsubsection{Automated Invasion Attack}
A sophisticated attacker may be able to mechanise the process of performing
attacks, making them possible on an extremely large scale. By exploiting the
pervasiveness of sensors in the IoT, an attacker may be able to infer things
that were previously unexpected. There is also the possibility of software
written to perform these attacks being sold on to less competent `hackers'. 

\subsection{Potential Attackers}
In order to prepare effective prevention mechanisms, the parties that are
likely to perform attacks should be well understood. McAfee identify the
following classes of attacker \cite{McAfee2011}.  

\subsubsection{White Hat Hackers}
White Hat Hackers do not intend to cause harm, or profit from the losses of
others. Penetration testers are professionals hired to ensure systems and
products are resilient to attack. Thorough penetration testing results in more
secure products for end users. Computer forensics experts, uncover digital
evidence in order to help convict criminals. Unfortunately it is possible for
legitimate tools to be used with malicious intent.

\subsubsection{Black Hat Hackers}
Black Hat Hackers are malicious attackers. In the past, they were typically
individuals performing attacks recreationally to satisfy curiosity. More
recently however, organised criminals with the intention of profiting from
cyber attacks have emerged. As consumers entrust the Internet with more
personal information, and perform more sensitive actions online, the value to
these criminals increases. This has spurred higher volumes of increasingly
sophisticated attacks. Organised crime poses a serious risk to residential
users of the IoT. 

\subsubsection{Script Kiddies}
A ``Script Kiddie'' is an attacker with limited technical skill -- they
rely on scripts produced by more experienced attackers. The low barrier of
entry makes this kind of attacker very common. The infamous hacker group
Anonymous makes heavy use of script kiddies. A small number of highly competent
individuals issue commands to a large mass of far less competent people, by
posting scripts on message boards such as 4chan. 

This class of attacker is probably the most likely to attack a home network;
the low barrier of entry means attacks may be originated from within the
network by a friend of family member who was believed to be trusted.  

\subsubsection{Hacktivists \& Cyber Terrorists}
Hacktivists and Cyber Terrorists usually claim there is higher motive behind
their attacks. They typically search for vulnerable systems with the aim of
producing as much havoc as possible. If they are able to cause severe
disruption, they will be eager to claim that their attack went exactly as
planned. 

It is possible that attackers of the future will find vulnerabilities in common
IoT devices. Cyber Terrorists may then exploit the vulnerability to raise
awareness of their cause, along with massive amounts of grief to home users. 

\subsubsection{State Sponsored Hackers}
State sponsored hackers are teams of highly skilled, government funded
professionals. As a result of their expertise and funding, their attacks are
the most sophisticated, frequently utilising several zero-day vulnerabilities.
Examples of suspected state sponsored attacks are the Advanced Persistent
Threats (APT) facing many governments and companies; and the Stuxnet worm
that targeted Iranian Nuclear Power Facilities, stifling the country's nuclear
program. Home users are not a typical target of state sponsored attack. 

\subsubsection{Spy Hackers}
Corporate and governmental espionage has existed throughout history. As the
world has gone digital, so have spies. Cracking systems to uncover their
adversaries' secrets is now common practice. One of the largest threats to
residential users is breaches of privacy resulting from mass surveillance
operations carried out by governments around the world.  


\section{Prevention and Mitigation}
With such a large number of potential attacks, many with the potential to be
incredibly damaging, mechanisms and policies are required to reduce harm that
can be done by an attack. 

\subsection{Legal Frameworks}
Legal frameworks should not be overlooked as an effective measure against cyber
criminals. It is commonly accepted that perfect security does not exists
\cite{ThereMustBeA}, implementers of secure products of any reasonable
complexity, are almost certain to make some mistakes. This lack of undeniable
security leads us to require laws to act as a safety net, deterring criminals
from committing computer crimes, and compensating victims attacks. An overview
of some of the relevant law can be found in \cite{Weber2010}. 

It may also be helpful to put in place regulations to force hardware and
software vendors to ship products in a secure state, and to place
strong recommendations on the minimum levels of testing required. 

\subsection{Hop-by-hop Encryption}
Hop-by-hop encryption is the encryption of messages between two directly
connected nodes. All of the  protocols mentioned in Section \ref{layer_1_2},
offer some form of encryption on their link. 

\subsubsection{WiFi Security}
WiFi security has a shaky past. The first WiFi security protocol, Wired
Equivalency Protocol (WEP) was completely insecure. As WEP uses a stream cipher
(RC4), it is vital that keys are never reused. WEP uses 24-bit initialisation
vectors (IV) to add uniqueness to the key stream. The Birthday Problem means
once ~5000 IVs\footnote{Calculated by $\sqrt[]{\frac{pi}{2} 2^{24}} $} have
been collected, the probability of a collision exceeds 50\%.  Once a collision
is found the Fluhrer, Mantin and Shamir attack can be used.  Using {\tt
aircrack-ng} any WEP key can be retrieved in a matter of seconds, with zero
understanding of the flaw. Once a WEP network has been cracked, all traffic to
and from the compromised access point can be deciphered.  Fortunately, WEP is
rarely used anymore.

WEP was replaced with Wifi Protected Access (WPA). There have been two versions
of WPA: WPA and WPA2. WPA was designed as a stop-gap measure only requiring a
firmware upgrade; whereas WPA2 is a long term solution requiring new hardware,
and uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). WPA has several modes, with
Preshared Key (PSK) being the most common among home users. The only known
WPA-PSK vulnerabilities are dictionary attacks, and the ability to build
rainbow tables; as long as users chose suitably strong passwords, along with a
random SSID, this is not be a problem. 

WiFi Protected Setup (WPS), was designed to increase the ease of setting up
WiFi networks, but also contained a serious vulnerability.  The flaw was a
result of the way that PINs were authorised: a eight digit PIN was used, but
was processed in two rounds resulting in a keyspace of only 11,000. {\tt
reaver-wps} can be used to retrieve any WPS PIN in under 24 hours. Some modern
routers ship with extra precautions, such as turning off WPS after several
failed attempts. 

\subsubsection{Bluetooth Security}
The Bluetooth specification defines a stream cipher known as E0. The design is
optimised for implementation in hardware, using multiple Linear Feedback Shift
Registers (LFSRs) and a simple state machine to generate a pseudorandom
keystream. 

In A Review of WPAN Security\cite{Kennedy2008}, a dizzying number of potential
attacks on Bluetooth, each with well fitting names, are presented. These include: 
\begin{itemize}[$\bullet$]
\item {\bf BlueJacking:} unexpected messages are sent to the victim hoping they
will reply with login details. 
\item {\bf BlueSnarf:} exploits the Object Exchange Push service to gain
access to a mobile phone's address book. 
\item {\bf BlueBump:} exploits the fact that link keys may be used after a session
has terminated. 
\item {\bf BlueSmack:} allows an attacker to perform a simple DoS attack by
exploiting the L2CAP layer.

\subsubsection{IEEE 802.15.4 Security}
IEEE 802.15.4 includes an extensive security specification, offering several
modes of operation: no security, encryption only, authentication only, and
encryption and authentication. 

The encryption engine used is AES, with Message Authentication Codes (MAC) used
for Authentication. The protocols are no perfect though, in 2004 Sastry et al
\cite{Sastry2004} outlined some of the major problems that existed.  


\subsection{End-to-end Encryption}
The inherent problem with hop-by-hop encryption is that each node on the path
between the sender and receiver is able to read the data, as it is decrypted
before being forwarded.   If a path contains nodes that are not trusted by the
sender, end-to-end encryption can be used to prevent the data being observed or
tampered with by a middle man. 

\subsubsection{DTLS}
When browsing the Web today, most users are familiar with the padlock symbol in
the corner of the browser, although few know what it actually means. It
indicates that communications to the web server are being secured with
Transport Layer Security (TLS). As it is likely that the IoT will use UDP
rather than TCP, TLS cannot be used, instead Datagram TLS (DTLS) will need to
be used. DTLS is very similar to TLS, allowing communications to be encrypted
using a wide variety of encryption algorithms.  

In February 2014, researchers at RHUL discovered a vulnerability in the
protocol, when Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) is used as the mode for the
encryption. 

It is also worth noting that there have been a number of serious flaws in
implementation of the SSL protocol. Firstly infamous 'goto fail' in an Apple
implementation of SSL, in which a repeated statement resulted in the incorrect
checking of SSL headers. And more recently the OpenSSL HeartBleed bug, in
which the heart beat extensions to SSL were incorrectly implemented. A lack of
bounds checking, allowed any user to request a large chunk of memory to be
return; by analysing the returned data within the constraints of x.509 headers,
researchers at Google were able to retrieve private keys for servers running
this implementation. 

\subsubsection{IPSec}
IPSec is the security extensions for IP. It offers the ability to authenticate
and encrypt IP packets. In early specifications for IPv6, IPSec was mandatory,
if one did not require security they could set the methods to NULL -- RFC6463
reduced the requirement to a recommendation. There has been a small amount
of work evaluating the feasibility of IPSec on constrained devices, that
has shown that it would be possible. 

IPSec can be operated in a number of different modes: Authentication Header
(AH), Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP), and Security Associations (SA).
In AH mode, an authentication header is added to to IP packets, to help
maintain the authenticity of the IP traffic. A counter also helps to prevent
against replay attacks. 

\subsubsection{Diet HIP}
The Host Identity Protocol (HIP) can be used to decouple the secure
identification of a host from its location, and allow authenticated
communications. Diet HIP is a cut back version of HIP that can be used on
constrained devices. 

\subsection{Jamming}
In `Defend Your Home!' \cite{Brown2013}, a novel mechanism is described for
improving the functionality of simplistic home automation hardware. A
centralised controller, attached to bridges for all the radio protocols used by
home automation devices in the home, is used to control appliances over the
internet. The  controller acts as a proxy for all of these devices, and exposes
them to the internet in some way. The controller  enhances security by
listening for any outside requests that could be interpreted by devices in the
home, and if they are not considered to be authentic, jamming signals are
generated to prevent the commands from having an effect. This mechanism can be
used to defend against accidental attack by a neighbour, or against simplistic
malicious attacks. 

\subsection{Service Level Security}
Many of the services provided by the network infrastructure may be vulnerable
to exploitation. SLAAC could be exploited by the spoofing of Router
Advertisements, causing a `thing' to connect to an unauthorised DNS server.
From here, the attacker could reply to DNS requests with the IP addresses of
machines owned by the attacker. The attack could then exfiltrate data or
possibly control the `thing'.

Service discovery poses similar threats if left insecure, a malicious actor may
be able to advertise a host that they control, tricking devices to pair with
it.

There are also routing protocol security questions. There is an RFC on this.  

\section{Proposed Security Architecture}
There are many design decisions that still need to be made when deploying the
IoT in the home. Although other factors, such as usability must not be
overlooked, security, must be among the top priorities when making these
decisions.  The design of home networks should make it as difficult as possible
for an attacker to perform a highly damaging attack. 

\subsection{End-to-end Addressability}
One of the biggest architectural arguments to have arisen with the introduction
of IPv6, is should we allow transparent, end-to-end addressability of devices.
With IPv4, the address space was so small that we had no choice, and were
forced to use Network Address Translation (NAT), which had the side effect of
removing end-to-end addressability. Although this breaks the end-to-end
principle, many users feel comfort in the fact that the devices inside their
network are not addressable from the outside.  

Many argue that NAT doesn't provide any security benefit over a well configured
firewall; reachability does not have to exist just because addressability does.
One counter argument to this is the number of bugs and vulnerabilities that
exist in the implementation of software, is it worth exposing the network to
risks of imperfection in software?

\subsection{Use of Application Layer Proxies}
Many of today's products do not allow for external addressing of sensors or
actuators, instead they act as application layer proxies for these devices.  

\subsection{Increased Host Security}
When the internet was first envisioned, each host was responsible for accepting
and rejecting traffic based on whether it was deemed to be genuine or not. With
the popularisation of networks in corporate setting, to increase the ease of
administration and to enforce company policy on employees, network filtering
was shifted to the network edge.

The nodes of the IoT are likely to be highly constrained in terms of processing
power. 

\subsection{Use Cases}
Consider some major use cases of the network.
How do these relate back to the security goals and identified threats?


\section{Future Work}
Despite the large body of work that has already been done into the security
considerations for the IoT in domestic networks, there are still many
unanswered questions. 

\subsection{Secure by Default}
One major challenge is ensuring that device vendors pick the correct security
protocols for their devices, and adhere to the specifications. It would also be
helpful to develop methods of encouraging product manufacturers to ship their
products with secure, randomly generated, user names and passwords in order to
reduce the number of attacks that are made of devices that have never been
configured away from their defaults.

\subsection{User Education}
Research must be done on how to teach users an effective mental model for
security in their home. The negative implications of uneducated users is two
fold: firstly, they are at risk of being the victim of an attack that damages
them; secondly, by running an insecure network, they may facilitate criminals
in attacking others -- vulnerable things could become part of a botnet of
things. As well as user education, increasingly easy to use devices is
desirable. 

\subsection{Outsourcing Security}
Although more technically inclined are likely to be strongly against it, many
users may benefit from the relocation of the security maintenance of their home
network from inside the home, to a third party, such as their ISP. 

\subsection{The Cloud of Things}
Cloud computing has been one of the largest advances in technology over the
past decade. Users are placing more and more of their data outside of their
personal machines. As the cloud merges with the IoT, more and more sensitive
data will find itself in the cloud. How can users protect themselves from their
service providers? And should the cloud provider be held responsible if data is
lost?

\subsection{Novel Network Paradigms}
There are a number of novel network paradigms that have been proposed as a
replacement of TCP/IP. One example, Information Centric Networking (ICN), aims
to replace IP with a naming system that is based on the content of the data
being requested, rather than the logial location of the data. Does this kind of
architecture need to be considered, and how can it be made secure?


\section{Conclusion}
It is clear that security is an important goal for the design of the IoT. As
technology consumes more and more of people's lives, it is essential that the
correct trade-offs are made from a security standpoint. 

So far, we have seen a large number of standards emerge, each attempting to
solve many of the problems that appear when connecting every day objects to the
Internet. At present it is less than obvious which protocols will succeed, and
which will fade into obscurity. Many of the products currently marketed to
consumers under the umbrella of 'The Internet of Things' do not fit with the
academic models of the IoT, instead opting for moderate energy protocols that
are more familiar to consumers. 

Whether consumer electronics eventually catches up with the academic
literature, or simply continues to evolve in a different direction, the IoT
holds a huge amount of potential -- both for greatness and disaster.
