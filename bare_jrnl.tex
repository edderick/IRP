\begin{abstract}
As the number and types of devices in the modern home grows, so does the
possibility for attack. The network technology powering the Internet of Things
must be designed with security and privacy considerations in mind from the
start. In this paper, a thorough review of the protocol stack, security
considerations and prevention mechanisms is given.

\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} ``Internet of Things'' (IoT) has become a common buzzword;
the term is thrown around liberally, without a single accepted definition
of the concept. The earliest use of the expression was by Kevin Ashton in 1999,
when describing the combination of RFID tags and the Internet to monitor the
supply chain at Procter \& Gamble \cite{Ashton2009}. 

A few years later, in 2005, the ITU published a report titled ``The Internet of
Things'' \cite{ITU_IoT}, which discussed how RFID could be used to give objects
from the real world a presence on the Internet. The report added a new
dimension to the Internet, suggesting that in the future connectivity would be
available at ``anytime'', in ``any place'', and to ``anything''.

More recent definitions of the IoT have shied away from limiting themselves to
RFID, favouring more feature rich protocols, such as 802.14.5, Bluetooth Low
Energy (BLE) and even WiFi. The one core theme that all definitions agree on,
is that as the IoT enters the mainstream, the number of devices connected to
the Internet will skyrocket -- Gartner predicts that by 2020, there will
be over 26 billion devices connected to the Internet \cite{Gartner2014}. 

In this paper, the IoT is taken to refer to the massive increase in
connectivity that we have already started to see in the past few years. This
conjunction of the traditional Internet, and the emerging IoT, has been
referred to as ``the Internet of Everything'' \cite{CiscoEverything}; it is
important not to neglect the increasing presence of more traditional devices on
the Internet. 

As we enter this increasingly connected age, security becomes a serious
concern. With more devices, falling into a wider range of device classes, the
number of attack surfaces grows. The first generation Internet took a lax
approach to security, focusing first on achieving functionality. This has lead
to an Internet (specifically the World Wide Web) that is insecure by default;
only recently have larger websites begun to use encrypted sessions (by
deploying TLS) to secure communications with their users. 

There has been a large amount of attention recently placed on the IoT in a
business and industrial context. Discussions of wireless sensor networks (WSN)
used to monitor manufacturing and agriculture, ensuring optimal production
capacity, along with proposals of complex policy management frameworks, are
common place. Interesting work has also been done in the area of vehicle
networks: at Def Con 21, a horrifying demonstration showed it is possible to
take control of a modern automobile \cite{Illera2014} putting the passengers in
serious danger.  There are clearly important security issues in these areas,
especially with respect to critical infrastructure. However, this paper chooses
to focus on the deployment of the IoT in a residential setting. 

Home networks offer a unique challenge —- they lack funding for expensive
network equipment, typically acquiring devices from a variety of vendors; they
rarely have access to a competent, professional systems administrator; and they
contain an increasing range of very personal devices and appliances
\cite{ACM_ModHome}. As such, security requirements are high, while the
difficulty of configuring the network to ensure an acceptable level of security
must be very low. 


\section{Technologies}
In the early days of the Internet, there was a wide range of competing
standards: DECnet, TCP/IP, AppleTalk, OSI and many others. Eventually TCP/IP
came out on top and now is a common standard used around the world. Similarly,
there are many competing technology stacks for the IoT. There are advantages
and disadvantages to each potential architecture, but few exists within a
vacuum -- each draws inspiration from the others. 

As with the Internet, it is convenient to think about the IoT in terms of the 7
layer OSI model\footnote{Although the TCP/IP model won the battle, the
numberings from the OSI model are still widely used in industry}.  The TCP/IP
model is built around a narrow waist of IP (either IPv4 or IPv6), with multiple
choices of protocol sitting above and below the IP layer. This has been a key
feature to the success of TCP/IP as it allows applications to be agnostic of
the lower layers, and the lower layers, in turn, agnostic of the applications
running above them. 

\subsection{Layers 1 \& 2 -- The Physical and Link Layers}
\label{layer_1_2}
The physical layer (PHY) defines the physical medium used for the transmission
of messages. Traditional networks made use of wired connections (such as
Ethernet) for this purpose. However, due to the expense and inconvenience of
installing wired networks, we have seen a transition towards wireless, radio
based technologies. The link layer is used to control access to the PHY layer
by devices wishing to communicate.

\subsubsection{WiFi}
IEEE 802.11 is the set of specifications defining WiFi. WiFi is probably the
most familiar wireless networking protocol to home users. The latest standard
for WiFi is 802.11ac, although due to the long life cycle of Customer Premises
Equipment (CPE), it is yet to be widely deployed; 802.11n is probably the
most widely used revision. 

WiFi is common as a wireless alternative to Ethernet, used on laptops, mobile
phones and tablets. For devices with mains connectivity or large batteries;
where cost is not a major factor, and high bandwidth is required, WiFi may be a
sensible choice. However, the high power usage makes it unsuitable for
constrained devices in the IoT.

\subsubsection{Bluetooth}
Bluetooth is a wireless communication technology used in Personal Area Networks
(PANs), intended as a wireless replacement for RS-232 serial cables. It
operates in the Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band, and is used
primarily for connecting mobile phones to headsets. Bluetooth has a lower
bandwidth and energy usage than WiFi, so is more suitable for connecting
constrained devices than WiFi. Unlike WiFi, Bluetooth also defines the higher
levels for communication. 

\subsubsection{Bluetooth Low Energy}
While Bluetooth was designed with power requirements in mind, it is not
suitable for ultra-low power devices. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), originally
named Wibree and currently marketed as Bluetooth Smart, is a non-backwards
compatible protocol designed to require far less power than the Bluetooth
Classic. 

One of the main advantages of BLE is that is can share the same antenna as
Bluetooth Classic, making it cheap for hardware manufactures to implement. We
have already seen a number of smart phones with support for BLE, most notably
the Apple iPhone 4S.

\subsubsection{RFID}
Much of the early work on the IoT focused on Radio-frequency Identification
(RFID). There are two basic types of RFID "tag": active tags, which are powered
by the reader; and passive tags, which have their own power source. The main
benefit of RFID is that the passive tags can be created very cheaply -- the
cheapest tags cost somewhere around \$0.05. More expensive active RFID tags can
have similar functionality to the other PHY layer standards. 

\subsubsection{IEEE 802.4.15}
IEEE 802.4.15 is among the most interesting PHY layer technologies for the IoT. It
has very low energy usage, but also a very low bandwidth. The very low energy
requirements makes 802.4.15 ideal for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) where
batteries cannot be replaced regularly. 

\subsubsection{Mobile Standards}
There are also many standards that are used in the cellular mobile
telecommunications industry -- most notably: 3G and 4G/LTE. In developing
countries where previous generation network infrastructure has not been
deployed, we are already seeing consumers who are jumping straight to mobile
technologies without ever using cable/broadband based internet
\cite{Kritzinger2013}. For many `things', mobile broadband may be the most
effective way of providing connectivity.  

WiMAX is another mobile technology that could have impact in the IoT. WiMAX
falls between 3G and WiFi in terms of range and speed, but so far has not
been widely deployed.  

\subsection{Layer 3 - The Network Layer}
The network layer is the narrow waist of the TCP/IP stack. On the traditional
Internet IPv6 is the preferred protocol for use in to the future.

\subsubsection{IP}
The Internet Protocol (IP) has two major versions: IPv4 and IPv6. Although most
networks at present still use IPv4, we have now run out of IPv4 addresses, so
in the future we will be forced to use IPv6.

IP is an important protocol as it is used almost universally by machines
connected to the Internet. An IP network does not need to know about the higher
level protocols to carry IP traffic, similarly, an IP packet is also not
concerned about the lower levels that carry it. 

\subsubsection{6LoWPAN}
Unfortunately IP was not designed with constrained devices in mind, as a
result, it is too resource intensive to run on many ``things''. 6LoWPAN is a
protocol that is designed to work around this problem by providing a
minimalistic subset of IPv6. It includes features such as header compression
and packet fragmentation. 6LoWPAN can be statelessly translated into IPv6 via
an inexpensive bridge or gateway. 

\subsubsection{ZigBee}
ZigBee is a set of protocols that run over IEEE 802.15.4. It is designed to be a
low cost option for wireless networks that require low power usage, and have no
bandwidth requirements. ZigBee defines the network layer, the application layer
and the high level concept of a ZigBee device object (ZDO). 

\subsubsection{WirelessHART}
WirelessHART is also built on top of 802.14.5, it is designed to be used for
industrial automation. 

\subsection{Layer 4 - The Transport Layer}
The transport layer runs on top of the network layer and provides multiplexing
for applications; optionally it also provides retransmission controls in the
form of TCP. A variety of factors mean that TCP is not suitable for the
low power lossy networks (LLNs) of the IoT, instead we must use UDP,
handling link reliability in a higher layer.

\subsection{Layer 7 - The Application Layer}
The application layer is probably the widest layer, since any application can
define an application layer if required. There are many familiar
application layer protocols that we use on a daily basis, including SSH,
FTP, SMTP, and DNS. 

\subsubsection{HTTP} 
With the advent of the World Wide Web (W3), it has been observed that HTTP has
become the de facto standard for applications. The concept of a RESTful
webservice is widely applied.  

\subsubsection{CoAP}
HTTP was not designed to be lightweight; instead the focus on human readability
is one of the things that contributed to the massive success it has had. For
constrained devices, HTTP is simply too bandwidth, and thus power, intensive.
The Constrained Applications Protocol (CoAP) is designed as a compatible subset
of HTTP. It is not a naive compression of HTTP, but rather a completely new
protocol with a stateless one-to-one mapping to (and from) HTTP. 

\subsubsection{EXI}
Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) is a binary format based on XML, that aims to
reduce the overheads needed for transmitting and parsing XML documents. XML is
a widely used document format on the internet, but due to its human readable
verbosity, it is not ideal for embedded devices where small overheads can make
processing impossible. 

\subsection{Other Protocols}
As well as the protocols that fall neatly into the OSI model, there are also
other protocols and services that are required for the IoT to function. These
include naming and service discovery, along with a number of middleware that
can be used to simplify the development of applications for the IoT.

\subsection{Overall Architecture}
It is very difficult at this point in time to identify which protocol stack, if
any, will become the standard for the IoT. 

At present, the academic and standards communities are confident that we will
see an IP based IoT. If this is the case, then the architecture detailed in
\cite{Palattella2013} is a good candidate as a standard protocol stack. This
architecture uses 802.15.4 as the PHY and MAC layers; 6LoWPAN as the network
layer; UDP for the transport layer; and CoAP as the Application layer. This
architecture is a good choice because it offers excellent compatibility, and
thus connectivity, to the traditional Internet, while avoiding degradation in
the performance of the IoT with heavy, power intensive protocols. It would also
be possible to run a similar protocol stack with BLE at Layer 1.  

In contrast, many of the ``smart'' devices available to consumers right now do
not follow this architecture. At the most basic end of this scale, we see home
automation kits based on simple radios (typically 433MHz), running proprietary
protocols, connecting to base stations or mobile phones. Examples of this
include LightWaveRF and Insteon. Presently, home automation is targeted mostly
at enthusiasts who are willing to build systems themselves using Raspberry Pi
and Arduino.  

Many mainstream devices use WiFi or Bluetooth Classic. LG and Whirlpool are
both manufacturing ranges of appliances with WiFi connectivity. Nest, a popular
manufacturer of smart thermostats -- now owned by Google -- support both WiFi
and 802.15.4 on their devices. The Fitbit and Nike Fuel band both connect to
smart phones over Bluetooth. These commercially available devices often lack
the always-on,  global connectivity envisioned in the IoT, instead connecting
to a single device which is used as an application layer proxy.

\section{Security Goals}
The internet is, for many, no longer a luxury, but a lifeline. Many of our
everyday tasks have been greatly simplified by the internet. The IoT will only
exaggerate this effect, increasing our reliance on technology. The devices that
make up the IoT that reside in our homes are likely to collect huge amounts of
sensitive information -- it is paramount that we avoid anything bad happening to
this data, as the consequences could be catastrophic. 

As we transition from an Internet containing only virtual entities to an
Internet consisting of real world objects as well, the damages that will be
possible through attack or data leak will increase. There are a number of
security and privacy goals that must be met for users to be able to place trust
in the IoT.

\subsection{Confidentiality}
A confidential message should only be readable by its intended recipients.
Mechanisms are needed to ensure that attackers are not able to intercept and
understand any messages that are transmitted. The level of confidentiality
required varies depending on the use case: for example, a temperature sensor in
a public place probably does not convey any information that an attacker could
not collect for themselves; whereas a medical sensor for a potentially
embarrassing medical condition will have much higher confidentiality
requirements. Wireless communication is particularly susceptible to
interception, this should not reduce the confidentiality of the messages.  

\subsection{Integrity}
Integrity is the concept that a message should be exactly the same when it is
received as it was when it was sent. Mechanisms are required to ensure that a
message does not change during transmission, if the message does change in
transit, it should be either automatically corrected, or discarded. A message
could be altered accidentally, through some error in the transmission process,
or it could be altered maliciously by an attacker. As the IoT will rely mainly
on wireless communications, both malicious and accidental changes are likely. 

\subsection{Availability}
Availability refers to the ability to make use of a service when it is needed.
On the regular Internet we are familiar with Denial of Service (DoS) attacks,
which render websites or networks completely unusable. The IoT needs mechanisms
that both prevent it from being the target of an availability reduction attack
and from being used as the source of DoS attacks.

\subsection{Non-repudiation}
Non-repudiation mechanisms ensure that if an action was performed by somebody,
then it is impossible for them to claim that they had not performed the action.
This security goal is not very relevant to the IoT. 

\subsection{Authenticity}
Authenticity is assuring that a message has been sent by the party from which
it claims to have been sent. In the IoT protocols should provide a way of
preventing attackers, for example, from pretending to be sensor nodes, and
submitting bogus readings, that could lead to undesired actions. It may be
helpful in the IoT to extend authenticity to provenance, recording a complete
history behind the origin of data.  

\subsection{Authorization}
Authorization ensures that the party sending a command is actually allowed
to make the request that they have made. Presently, we often see WiFi routers
and other embedded devices that ship with well known default usernames
and password. This makes it very easy for an attacker to guess the login
credentials. If things do not change, then we are likely to see the same
phenomenon in the IoT. In early 2014, Proofpoint found that many low power
devices, including one smart refrigerator, were being used to send spam emails
\cite{Proofpoint2014}.

\subsection{Usability \& Accessibility}
Although not strictly a security goal, when designing systems, it is of
adamant importance that usability is considered. For a security system to be
successful, the target audience must not struggle to use it -- if the end
user is unable to configure devices in a secure manner, then there may as well
be no security at all. 

It is important to remember that not only do the majority of home users of
the IoT lack a deep technical understanding of the hardware and software
that they are using, they also often do not have the time or the will to learn.
As such, the actions required to enable security should be as simple as
possible. One way of achieving this may be to hide as much of the underlying
cryptographic mechanism as possible from the end user.

In the past, accessibility has often been ignored all together when designing
secure systems -- WiFi passwords are typically printed in tiny writing on the
underside of routers, making the task of discovering WiFi passwords difficult
even for able bodies people. For many of the goals of the IoT to be reached,
especially with regards to devices designed to help people with disabilities,
accessibility needs to be made a priority.  

\section{Security Threats}
It is difficult to develop a strategy of prevention and mitigation without
first understanding some of the potential attacks that should be defended
against.  

\subsection{Attack Types}
H. Ning et al \cite{Ning2013} divide the types of attack into the following
four broad categories:

\subsubsection{Gathering}
Gathering attacks involve collecting information by eavesdropping on
communications channels, or gaining access to storage areas. As a result of the
Snowden leaks in 2013, it was revealed that the US government has been
collecting metadata on the communications of civilians around the world -- as
response the Guardian published an article detailing how much can be inferred
from metadata alone \cite{Guardian2013}. 

Gathering attacks are a breach of confidentiality. 

\subsubsection{Imitation}
Pretending to be someone (or something) you are not, in order to gain access to
a resource that you are not authorised to gain access to. A classic attack is
MAC address spoofing which can be used to perform a variety of attacks. Replay
attacks are also a form of imitation that must be defended against. This
category of attacks includes man-in-the-middle attacks, whereby an attacker
intercepts all communications between two parties, and relays the
communications fooling the two end points into believing they are communicating
directly. 

\subsubsection{Blocking}
Blocking refers to reducing the availability of a service. Blocking can be
achieved at almost any layer of the network. At the physical layer, radio
frequencies can be jammed; at the application layer, resources can be consumed
unnecessarily by an attacker. The most well known form of a blocking attack is
Denial of Service (DoS). 

\subsubsection{Privacy}
Privacy attacks seek to deprive victims of their privacy. One of major concerns
is of the identification of people in public places, based on the devices that
they are carrying. In 2006 security researchers at the Black Hat conference
\cite{Flexilis2006} expressed concerns that a side channel attack on the
proposed US e-passports could be used to identify travellers as American
citizens while they were travelling abroad, exposing them to unnecessary risk.

The privacy of a users geographic location, is also a strong concern as an
increasing number of devices contain GPS modules. 

\subsection{Attack Levels}
In \cite{Elkhodr2013} the types of attack are separated into five different
levels of attack. These attacks refer information security, the practice of
restricting access to data to certain groups, and are applicable mostly to
privacy issues in the IoT.

\subsubsection{First-Hand Attack}
In a first hand attack, a user inadvertently divulges some information to
another party. Either through misconfigured privacy settings, or through the
breach of a vulnerable security protocol, an attacker can gain valuable
(possibly personal) information, that they would not otherwise have been able
to gain. Although it would be easy to blame poorly configured privacy
settings\footnote{Or insecure passwords for that matter.} on the user
themselves, a security breach that results from a difficult to use system,
could be considered to be the fault of the system designers. 

\subsubsection{Gossip Attack}
A gossip attack is one in which the attacker gains some information by
compromising a node that does not directly interact with the victim. Instead
the attacker gains access to a node that may be several hops away from any
nodes that have direct interaction with the target, this device contains
sensitive information that has been relayed to it by other nodes. In this
scenario, the exploited node may be far from the control of the victim, as a
result, a large emphasis must be placed on deciding which peers are
trustworthy, and what information should be shared with them.

\subsubsection{Observation Attack}
An observation attack makes use of sensors placed (or compromised) by an
attacker with the intent of gaining information about their victims. An
attacker might also attempt to capture network traffic with the aim of gleaning
some information about the victim. Observation attacks differ from the other
attacks, because they may make use of sensors owned by the attacker, that have
simply been strategically placed for an attack. 

\subsubsection{Inference Attack}
Inference attacks exploit the huge body of data that will be collected in the
IoT, linking the data in unexpected ways to obtain (or gain a strong suspicion
of) sensitive information that was not revealed by the possession of a single
data source. Understanding privacy in anonymised datasets is a current area of
research, with large amounts of work being done looking into differential privacy
and similar concepts. In 2007 Netflix launched a competition to improve the
user ratings of their films; soon after the competition was launched, two
researchers from the University of Texas were able to identify individual users
by correlating the data with that found on IMDB\cite{Narayanan2008}.

\subsubsection{Automated Invasion Attack}
A sophisticated attacker may be able to mechanise the process of performing
attacks, making them possible on an extremely large scale. By exploiting the
pervasiveness of sensors in the IoT, an attacker may be able to infer things
that were previously unexpected. There is also the possibility of software
written to perform these attacks being sold on to less competent `hackers'. 

\subsection{Potential Attackers}
In order to prepare effective prevention mechanisms, the parties that are
likely to perform attacks should be well understood. The list of potential
attack includes individuals and teams with a great range of competency and
experience. McAee identify the following classes of attacker\cite{McAfee2011}.  

\subsubsection{White Hat Hackers}
White hats are the ``good guys''. Their actions are not carried out with
the intention of causing harm or profiting from the loss of others. This
category includes penetration testers, who are hired by companies to ensure
that their systems are difficult for other attackers to exploit. The existence
of this kind of security professional should result in more secure products for
end users, although it is possible for any of the tools developed for
legitimate use to be used in a malicious way.

\subsubsection{Black Hat Hackers}
Black hat hackers, conversely, are malicious attackers. In the past, it was
observed that this kind of attacker was typically an individual attempting to
perform attacks recreational to satisfy curiosity.  

More recently however, we have seen a change towards organised criminals with
the intention of profiting from their attacks. As we are entrusting the
internet with more of our personal information, and performing more sensitive
actions online, the value to these criminals has increased; the increase value
has spurred the development of more sophisticated attacks. 

Organised crime poses a serious risk to residential users of the IoT. 

\subsubsection{Script Kiddies}
A ``Script Kiddie'' is an attacker who has very limited technical skill of his
own, instead relying on scripts produced by more experienced attackers. As a
result of the very low barrier of entry to using scripts to perform malicious
attacks, script kiddies are very common. The hacker group Anonymous operates as
a small number of highly competent individuals, who issue commands to a large
mass of far less competent people -- this is often achieved by posting a script
on a message board. This class of attacker is probably the most likely to
attack a home network. With the low barrier of entry, homeowners must be wary
of the potential of attacks being originated from within their network by
friends of family who were believed to be trusted.  

\subsubsection{Hacktivists \& Cyber Terrorists}
Hacktivist and Cyber Terrorists usually claim to have a higher motive to their
attacks than mere financial gain. This kind of attacker typically search for
vulnerable systems, with the aim of producing as much havoc as possible. If
they are able to cause a severe disruption somewhere, they are typically quite
eager to claim that their attack was premeditated in some way. 

It is possible that attackers of the future will find vulnerabilities in common
hardware attached to the IoT, and attack it, raising awareness of their cause,
along with massive amounts of grief to home users. 

\subsubsection{State Sponsored Hackers}
State sponsored hackers are teams of highly skilled professionals, working with
funding from a government. The attacks performed by these attackers are likely
to be the most sophisticated, thanks to the high level of expertise and funding
available. Examples of state sponsored\footnote{Or strongly suspected to be.}
attacks, are the Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) that many governments and
companies are dealing with. The most famous single example is probably the
highly targeted Stuxnet worm that targeted Iranian Nuclear Power Facilities,
stifling progress in the countries nuclear program. 

\subsubsection{Spy Hackers}
Corporate and governmental espionage has a long history. Recently, as the world
has gone digital, a focus on cracking systems to uncover the secrets of
adversaries has emerged. One of the largest threats to residential users is
removal of privacy through the mass surveillance operations that are being
carried out by governments around the world.  

\section{Prevention and Mitigation}
With such a large number of potential attacks, all with the ability to do huge
amounts of damage, we need mechanisms and policies in place to reduce the
amount of damage that can be done by an attacker. 

\subsection{Legal Frameworks}
Legal frameworks should not be overlooked as an effective measure against cyber
criminals. It is commonly accepted that perfect security does not exists
\cite{ThereMustBeA}, implementers of secure products of any reasonable
complexity, are almost certain to make some mistakes. This lack of undeniable
security leads us to require laws to act as a safety net, deterring criminals
from committing computer crimes, and compensating victims attacks. An overview
of some of the relevant law can be found in \cite{Weber2010}. 

It may also be helpful to put in place regulations to force hardware and
software vendors to ship products in a secure default state, and to place
strong recommendations on the minimum levels of testing required. 

\subsection{Hop-by-hop Encryption}
Hop-by-hop encryption is the encipherment of messages between two nodes on the
communication path. All of the  protocols mentioned in Section \ref{layer_1_2}, offer
some level of encryption on their link. 

\subsubsection{WiFi Security}
In terms of security, WiFi has had a shaky past. The first security protocol
for WiFi, Wired Equivalency Protocol (WEP) had serious issues that left it
completely insecure. WEP made use of the RC4 stream cipher -- which itself
is still considered secure -- however, as a stream cipher, it is important
that the same key is never used twice. The way that WEP added this
uniqueness to the key stream was through the use of 24-bit initialisation
vectors (IV). Because of the Birthday Problem, only around 5000
\footnote{Calculated by $\sqrt[]{\frac{pi}{2} 2^{24}} $} IVs need to be
collected before the probability of collision exceeds 50\%.  The attack to
exploit this is known as the Fluhrer, Mantin and Shamir attack. Using the
software package {\tt aircrack-ng} an unskilled attacker can crack WEP keys
in a matter of seconds. Once a WEP network has been cracked, an attacker
can read all of the traffic that is sent to the compromised access point.
WEP has, for the most part, been phased out of common use.

WEP was replaced with Wifi Protected Access (WPA). There have been two
revisions of WPA: WPA and WPA2 -- WPA was designed as a stop-gap measure that
was deployable to the same hardware as WEP, requiring only a firmware upgrade;
WPA2 on the other hand was proposed as a long term solution, and uses the
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). The only widely known WPA2 vulnerability is
the dictionary attack; as long as users chose suitably long
passwords\footnote{When operated in Preshared Key Mode(PSK)}, along with a
random SSID, this should not be a problem. 

Another extension, WiFi Protected Setup (WPS), which was designed to increase
the ease of setting up WiFi networks, also contained a serious vulnerability.
The flaw was a result of the way that PINs were authorised: a eight digit PIN
was used, but was processed in two rounds resulting in a keyspace of only
11,000. {\tt reaver-wps} is a tool that can be used to retrieve any WPS PIN in
under 24 hours. Some modern routers ship with extra precautions, such as
turning off WPS after several failed attempts, but many do not. 

\subsubsection{Bluetooth Security}
The security used in Bluetooth is known as the E0 encryption engine. 

In A Review of WPAN Security\cite{Kennedy2008}, a dizzying number of potential
attacks on Bluetooth, each with well fitting names, are presented. These include: 
\begin{itemize}
\item BlueJacking: a simple attack in which the attacker sends unexpected
messages to a victim in an attempt to get them to reply with login details. 
\item BlueSnarf: an attack that exploits the Object Exchange Push service to
gain unauthorised access to a mobile phones address book. 
\item BlueBump: exploits the fact that link keys may be used after a session
has terminated. 
\item BlueSmack: allows an attacker to perform a simple DoS attack by
exploiting the L2CAP layer.
\item BlueDump: can be used to cause a device to dump its link key if the
Bluetooth Address of the device is known. 
\item BlueChop: by confusing the master node of a piconet, a DoS attack can be
performed. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{End-to-end Encryption}
The inherent problem with hop-by-hop encryption is that each node on the path
between the sender and receiver is able to read the data, as it is decrypted
before being forwarded.   If a path contains nodes that are not trusted by the
sender, end-to-end encryption can be used to prevent the data being observed or
tampered with by a middle man. 

\subsubsection{DTLS}
When browsing the Web today, most users are familiar with the padlock symbol in
the corner of the browser, although few know what it actually means. It
indicates that communications to the web server are being secured with
Transport Layer Security (TLS). As it is likely that the IoT will use UDP
rather than TCP, TLS cannot be used, instead Datagram TLS (DTLS) will need to
be used. DTLS is very similar to TLS, allowing communications to be encrypted
using a wide variety of encryption algorithms.  

In February 2014, researchers at RHUL discovered a vulnerability in the
protocol, when Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) is used as the mode for the
encryption. 

It is also worth noting that there have been a number of serious flaws in
implementation of the SSL protocol. Firstly infamous 'goto fail' in an Apple
implementation of SSL, in which a repeated statement resulted in the incorrect
checking of SSL headers. And more recently the OpenSSL HeartBleed bug, in
which the heart beat extensions to SSL were incorrectly implemented. A lack of
bounds checking, allowed any user to request a large chunk of memory to be
return; by analysing the returned data within the constraints of x.509 headers,
researchers at Google were able to retrieve private keys for servers running
this implementation. 

\subsubsection{IPSec}
IPSec is the security extensions for IP. It offers the ability to authenticate
and encrypt IP packets. In early specifications for IPv6, IPSec was mandatory,
if one did not require security they could set the methods to NULL -- RFC6463
reduced the requirement to a recommendation. There has been a small amount
of work evaluating the feasibility of IPSec on constrained devices, that
has shown that it would be possible. 

IPSec can be operated in a number of different modes: Authentication Header
(AH), Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP), and Security Associations (SA).

\subsubsection{Diet HIP}
The Host Identity Protocol (HIP) can be used to decouple the secure
identification of a host from its location, and allow authenticated
communications. Diet HIP is a cut back version of HIP that can be used on
constrained devices. 

\subsection{Jamming}
In `Defend Your Home!' \cite{Brown2013}, a novel mechanism is described for
improving the functionality of simplistic home automation hardware. A
centralised controller, attached to bridges for all the radio protocols used by
home automation devices in the home, is used to control appliances over the
internet. The  controller acts as a proxy for all of these devices, and exposes
them to the internet in some way. The controller  enhances security by
listening for any outside requests that could be interpreted by devices in the
home, and if they are not considered to be authentic, jamming signals are
generated to prevent the commands from having an effect. This mechanism can be
used to defend against accidental attack by a neighbour, or against simplistic
malicious attacks. 

\subsection{Service Level Security}
Service discovery, Router advertisements, etc.

\section{Proposed Security Architecture}
There are many design decisions that still need to be made when deploying the
IoT in the home. Although other factors, such as usability must not been over
looked, security, must be among the top priorities when making these decisions.
The design of home networks should make it as difficult as possible for an
attacker to perform a highly damaging attack. 

\subsection{End-to-end Addressability}
One of the biggest architectural arguments to have arisen with the introduction
of IPv6, is should we allow transparent, end-to-end addressability of devices.
With IPv4, the address space was so small that we had no choice, and were
forced to use Network Address Translation (NAT), which had the side effect of
removing end-to-end addressability. Although this breaks the end-to-end
principle, many users feel comfort in the fact that the devices inside their
network are not addressable from the outside.  

Many argue that NAT doesn't provide any security benefit over a well configured
firewall; reachability does not have to exist just because addressability does.
One counter argument to this is the number of bugs and vulnerabilities that
exist in the implementation of software, is it worth exposing the network to
risks of imperfection in software.

\subsection{Use of Application Layer Proxies}
Many of todays products do not allow for external addressing of sensors or
actuators, instead they act as application layer proxies for these devices.  

\subsection{Increased Host Security}
When the internet was first envisioned, each host was responsible for accepting
and rejecting traffic based on whether it was deemed to be genuine or not. With
the popularisation of networks in corporate setting, to increase the ease of
administration and to enforce company policy on employees, network filtering
was shifted to the network edge.

The nodes of the IoT are likely to be highly constrained in terms of processing
power. 

\subsection{Use Cases}
Consider some major use cases of the network.
How do these relate back to the security goals and identified threats?


\section{Future Work}
Despite the large body of work that has already been done into the security
considerations for the IoT in domestic networks, there are still many
unanswered questions. 

\subsection{Secure by Default}
One major challenge is ensuring that device vendors pick the correct security
protocols for their devices, and adhere to the specifications. It would also be
helpful to methods of encouraging product manufacturers to ship their products
with secure, randomly generated, user names and passwords in order to reduce
the number of attacks that are made of devices that have never been configured
away from their defaults.

\subsection{User Education}
Research must be done on how to teach users an effective mental model for security in their home.

\subsection{Outsourcing Security}
Although it sounds like a nightmare scenario to the more paranoid and/or
technically inclined. Many users may benefit from the relocation of the
security maintenance of their home network form inside the home, to a third
party, such as their ISP. 

\subsection{The Cloud of Things}
Cloud computing has been one of the largest advances in technology over the
past decade. Users are placing more and more of their data outside of their
personal machines. As the cloud collides with the IoT, more and more sensitive
data will find itself in the cloud. How can users protect themselves from their
service providers? And should the cloud provider be held responsible if data is
lost?

\subsection{Novel Network Paradigms}
There are a number of novel network paradigms that have been proposed as a
replacement of TCP/IP. Information Centric Networking (ICN), aims to replace IP
with a naming system that is based on the content of the data being requested,
rather than the logial location of the data. Does this kind of architecture
need to be considered, and how can it be made secure?


\section{Conclusion}
A summary and evaluation of the findings presented in the paper.

\begin{itemize}
\item A lot of products don't actually follow the academic research
\item A lot of the academic research is very hand wavy
\end{itemize}
